Unittests incorporated with CI do not include testing for utils.data_download.download_kaggle_datasets function. 

The download_kaggle_dataset function contains the code to use the Kaggle API to download datasets to the repo. We attempted to create a mock object, but ran into issues related to running the kaggleapi import statement. 

For the kaggle api import statement to work, either the kaggle.json file needs to be saved in a specific location on the local machine (reference Kaggle API documentation), or environment variables need to be set with a kaggle username and api key. This would essentially require hard coding the username and api key, which would defeat the point of using the mock object.

Kaggle API Documentation
https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api
Reference from Kaggle documentation: "the tool will look for this
token at ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json on Linux, OSX, and other UNIX-based operating systems, and at C:\Users<Windows-username>.kaggle\kaggle.json on Windows"


We decided to not test this API function repeatedly based on how long each test takes to execute. We removed as much code as possible from the utils.data_download.download_kaggle_datasets function, and tested sparingly from a local machine.

Unittests for utils.data_download.download_kaggle_datasets will work from a local machine after the kaggle.json file is saved to the local machine and the location of this file is passed to the download_kaggle_datasets function in the rotten_tomatoes/data_download file.
